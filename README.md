# Spider In Ruby #

In fact, it's not a spider but a collector.

I'd like to collect prices, images and urls of Nikon lens from websites such as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.cn), [Jingdong](http://www.jd.com) and [Dangdang](http://www.dangdang.com). It's because I want to buy lens when they are in sales and it's inelegant to look on different websites from time to time. As for programmers, Don't Repeat Yourself! 

I want to show the information on my own website. This project is the core module for the collector. It could get the html of the websites by the use of [Watir](https://github.com/watir/watir-webdriver) and analyze the content by the use of [Hpricot](https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot). If you input the name, the program will output the prices, image url and product urls in the command line.

I have recorded the errors when accomplishing the project at my blog, pls refer to [http://lantianyue.com/2014/01/用Ruby实现简单小爬虫/](http://lantianyue.com/2014/01/用Ruby实现简单小爬虫/).
